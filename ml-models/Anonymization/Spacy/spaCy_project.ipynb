Her second film Dreamgirls, the film version of the 1981 Broadway musical loosely based on The Supremes, received acclaim from critics and grossed $154 million internationally. In it, she starred opposite Jennifer Hudson, Jamie Foxx, and Eddie Murphy playing a pop singer based on Diana Ross. To promote the film, Beyonce released \\\"Listen\\\" as the lead single from the soundtrack album. In April 2007, Beyonce embarked on The Beyonce Experience, her first worldwide concert tour, visiting 97 venues and grossed over $24 million.[note 1] Beyonce conducted pre-concert food donation drives during six major stops in conjunction with her pastor at St. John's and America's Second Harvest.
